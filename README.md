Project Possession is a top down game with the sole purpose of eliminating as many monsters as possible to beat out the other players. It is possible to play up to 4 people in an online match.

I worked as a gameplay developer doing the dash behaviour of the characters and it's replication on the server and client machines.

## Gravity Lander - January 2022

#### Platform: Windows

#### Build: UE4/C++

#### Source Code: [Github](https://github.com/viversba/GravityLander)

Gravity Lander is a **3D platformer** in which the player has to pilot a ship on the surface of the moon to land it on a Finishing platform before fuel runs out while avoiding obstacles that slow the ship's boost force down. The ship gets a boost every time the player hits the `Space` key and the player is able to rotate the ship by pressing the `Lef` and `Right` keys on the keyboard.

The game has a level system with increased difficulty like increased randomized distance to the Finishing platform and increasing number of obstacles as the level increaces.

The game was made using Unreal Engine 4.26 and C++ for the logic.

## Unity UML - January 2019

#### Platform: Unity Editor
#### Build: Unity/C#

Source Code: [Github](https://github.com/viversba/UnityUML)

Complete tool for generating UML class diagrams inside Unity. The tool has support for the following C# Entities:

* Properties
* Methods
* Structs
* Classes
* Interfaces
* Constants
* Variables
* Class Parameters
* Interface Parameters

![DEngine1](https://media.giphy.com/media/CNDaGQP8zayFXtGm6X/giphy.gif)

Currently, the tool supports the following relations:

* Inheritace
* Implementation

The tool is built on top of Antlr4, and uses purely C# code and custom generated DLLs, no additional JARs. It was built to be used inside the Unity Editor and has many features like source code scanning, selective diagrams, and diagram serialization for storing information about a diagram on project.

## Inverse Kinematics with Arduino - Research Project - June 2018

#### Platform: Android & Arduino
#### Build: Unity/C# & C++

#### Link to Article: [Inverse Kinematics Using Arduino and Unity for People with Motor Skill Limitations](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19945-6_9)

#### Source Code: [Unity](https://github.com/viversba/VRIMU), [Arduino C++](https://github.com/viversba/VRImu_Arduino) 

Arduino based Inertial Motion Unit (IMU) for capturing movement using simple sensors and interfacing those movements on an Android VR game. The original purpose of the project was to help people with limited mobility on their limbs to do therapy through a video game, thus recovering mobility. The result of this research project was published as an article on the Lecture Notes in Computer Science journal under the DOI: `10.1007/978-3-030-19945-6_9`.

The project features 9DOF movement capture with noise filtering for the Arduino Sensors with LE Bluetooth communication with the Android device. The Arduino sensors are placed on the elbow of the player and as they move and rotate the elbow, the movement is reflected on the character of the game, who has to fight off many enemies in virtual reality.

## Game Based Learning - May 2018

#### Platform: Android

#### Build: Unity/C#

Android game made with educational purposes for the School of Humanity and Social Sciences of the National University of Colombia. The game is a 2D adventure game, in which the character has to solve the mistery of a missing teacher while acquiring knowledge about how to do research. 

![Metodos1](https://media.giphy.com/media/rVdkibkmEl4zNcBxSX/giphy.gif)

The basic mechanism of the game consists of multiple trivias of many kinds (multiple question choices, puzzles, etc...) that when solved correctly, give the player clues for where and who to interact next with.

The executable and the source code belong to the National University of Colombia and were not made public.

## Swarm War - October 2020

#### Platform: Web

#### Build: 8th Wall/JS (A-Frame and ThreeJS)

Swarm war is a web based AR game in which the player has to shoot down enemy drones by tapping on them before they reach the player. The game involves sound and visual effects as well as a score counter.

![Swarm Gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/CyjuZyDUr0GPVTWbcM/giphy.gif)

The basic idea of the game is that multiple enemy drones are spawned at random distances and rotations around the player and are programmed to reach the player at a certain speed. Being an AR game, the player can move in the world and the planes will still follow the player to wherever they go. If a drone reaches the player, it will be game over, and the player will have to restart the game.

## F35 Advertising campaign - April 2021

#### Platform: Web

#### Build: 8th Wall/JS (A-Frame, ThreeJS, and React JS)

Simple Web based AR experience to show the main features of the F35 plane. This project is a combination of two JS frameworks, using  A-Frame for the AR and 3D world, and ReactJS for the interface.

![F35](https://media.giphy.com/media/oP5LBTsMjcrienjsoa/giphy-downsized-large.gif)

The purpose of the project is to showcase the main features of the F35 plane as an interactive experience.
