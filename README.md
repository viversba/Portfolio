Sniper is a 2D game in which you are given a randomly generated character that you have to find in the crowd and kill. You're given a contract with the character to find and in a 'where's waldo' fashion, your task is to find them and also eliminate them.

I worked as GDScript developer on many aspects of the game:
* Random character generation & behavior.
* Environment design.

## Project Possession - August 2022

#### Platform: Windows

#### Efecto Studios. Role: Gameplay Developer

#### Build: UE5/C++

#### Download free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2090180/Project_Possession/).
![Project Possession](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2090180/header.jpg?t=1660750254)

Project Possession is an online top down multiplayer game in which you play as a ghost that 'possesses' monsters in order to use their abilities to kill other monsters. There are three types of monsters which you can possess, and minion like creatures that give you a small amount of points per kill. 

The goal of the game is to kill other creatures to earn the highest amount of points. The monster you are possessing can be killed, although the possessing character (the ghost) cannot, so every time your possessed creature dies you can possess a different monster to keep earning points.

I worked as a gameplay developer doing the dash behaviour of the characters and its replication on the server and client machines.

## Gravity Lander - January 2022

#### Platform: Windows

#### Build: UE4/C++

#### Source Code: [Github](https://github.com/viversba/GravityLander)

Gravity Lander is a **3D platformer** in which the player has to pilot a ship on the surface of the moon to land it on a Finishing platform before fuel runs out while avoiding obstacles that slow the ship's boost force down. The ship gets a boost every time the player hits the `Space` key and the player is able to rotate the ship by pressing the `Lef` and `Right` keys on the keyboard. 

![Lander_gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/Du15On1CLiNgKHk5ck/giphy.gif)

The game has a level system with increased difficulty like increased randomized distance to the Finishing platform and increasing number of obstacles as the level increaces.

The game was made using Unreal Engine 4.26 and C++ for the logic.

## Unity UML - January 2019

#### Platform: Unity Editor
#### Build: Unity/C#

Source Code: [Github](https://github.com/viversba/UnityUML)

Complete tool for generating UML class diagrams inside Unity. The tool has support for the following C# Entities:

* Properties
* Methods
* Structs
* Classes
* Interfaces
* Constants
* Variables
* Class Parameters
* Interface Parameters

![DEngine1](https://media.giphy.com/media/CNDaGQP8zayFXtGm6X/giphy.gif)

Currently, the tool supports the following relations:

* Inheritace
* Implementation

The tool is built on top of Antlr4, and uses purely C# code and custom generated DLLs, no additional JARs. It was built to be used inside the Unity Editor and has many features like source code scanning, selective diagrams, and diagram serialization for storing information about a diagram on project.

## Inverse Kinematics with Arduino - Research Project - June 2018

#### Platform: Android & Arduino
#### Build: Unity/C# & C++

#### Link to Article: [Inverse Kinematics Using Arduino and Unity for People with Motor Skill Limitations](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19945-6_9)

#### Source Code: [Unity](https://github.com/viversba/VRIMU), [Arduino C++](https://github.com/viversba/VRImu_Arduino) 

Arduino based Inertial Motion Unit (IMU) for capturing movement using simple sensors and interfacing those movements on an Android VR game. The original purpose of the project was to help people with limited mobility on their limbs to do therapy through a video game, thus recovering mobility. The result of this research project was published as an article on the Lecture Notes in Computer Science journal under the DOI: `10.1007/978-3-030-19945-6_9`.

![VRImu](https://media.giphy.com/media/fWrCiuNZMwnrOLfCrF/giphy.gif)

The project features 9DOF movement capture with noise filtering for the Arduino Sensors with LE Bluetooth communication with the Android device. The Arduino sensors are placed on the elbow of the player and as they move and rotate the elbow, the movement is reflected on the character of the game, who has to fight off many enemies in virtual reality.

## Game Based Learning - May 2018

#### Platform: Android

#### Build: Unity/C#

Android game made with educational purposes for the School of Humanity and Social Sciences of the National University of Colombia. The game is a 2D adventure game, in which the character has to solve the mistery of a missing teacher while acquiring knowledge about how to do research. 

![Metodos1](https://media.giphy.com/media/rVdkibkmEl4zNcBxSX/giphy.gif)

The basic mechanism of the game consists of multiple trivias of many kinds (multiple question choices, puzzles, etc...) that when solved correctly, give the player clues for where and who to interact next with.

![Metodos2](https://media.giphy.com/media/WFo3Wd7Sa66qyPeHV8/giphy.gif)

The executable and the source code belong to the National University of Colombia and were not made public.

## Swarm War - October 2020

#### Platform: Web

#### Build: 8th Wall/JS (A-Frame and ThreeJS)

Swarm war is a web based AR game in which the player has to shoot down enemy drones by tapping on them before they reach the player. The game involves sound and visual effects as well as a score counter.

![Swarm Gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/CyjuZyDUr0GPVTWbcM/giphy.gif)

The basic idea of the game is that multiple enemy drones are spawned at random distances and rotations around the player and are programmed to reach the player at a certain speed. Being an AR game, the player can move in the world and the planes will still follow the player to wherever they go. If a drone reaches the player, it will be game over, and the player will have to restart the game.
